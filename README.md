# Evaluation of 5G Introduction

## Revenue Impact
- **Overall Revenue**: Contrary to initial projections, overall revenue experienced a slight decrease of -0.50% after the 5G launch. This decline could be attributed to initial 5G infrastructure costs, promotional discounts, or user reluctance in transitioning to the new technology.
- **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)**: There was a significant increase of 11.05% in ARPU, indicating that users who adopted 5G were spending more on average. This rise could be due to higher data usage, premium plans, or additional services offered with 5G.
- **Active Users**: Active user count dropped by 8.28%, possibly due to users pausing their services or switching providers during the 5G rollout.
- **Churn Rate**: The churn rate surged by 23.50%, suggesting a notable number of users left the service, potentially due to dissatisfaction with the transition, competitive offers, or issues with 5G service quality.

## Revenue Analysis by City

### Positive Trends
- **Mumbai**: Post-5G launch, Mumbai saw a significant revenue increase, indicating strong adoption and a positive reception of the new technology.
- **Bangalore**: Bangalore also experienced a revenue boost, suggesting that its tech-savvy population quickly adopted and utilized 5G services.

### Lower Performance
- **Delhi**: Revenue growth was modest in Delhi, possibly due to market saturation, competitive offers, or slower adoption rates.
- **Chennai**: Chennai exhibited lower revenue performance, likely due to similar reasons as Delhi, including local market dynamics or user skepticism about 5G.

## Trends in User Behavior

### Increased Spending

### Lower Adoption
- **Chennai and Pune**: These cities showed less enthusiasm for adopting 5G, potentially due to lack of awareness, higher costs associated with 5G plans, or satisfaction with existing 4G services.

## Insights into User Engagement

### High Engagement Areas
- **Pune**: Pune demonstrated high user engagement post-5G launch, possibly due to effective marketing, a tech-friendly population, or superior 5G infrastructure and service quality.

### Areas with Decline in Engagement
- **General Trend**: Some regions experienced a decline in user engagement, possibly due to network issues, insufficient promotion of 5G benefits, or initial rollout challenges.

## Performance Review of Service Plans

### Plans with Improved Performance
- **General Trend**: Most service plans showed improved performance following the 5G introduction. Users likely upgraded to take advantage of the new technology, enhancing overall plan performance.

### Underperforming Plan
- **Plan P7 ("25 GB Combo 3G / 4G Data Pack")**: This plan saw a decrease in popularity post-5G launch, as users likely shifted to 5G-specific plans or found the 3G/4G plan less valuable compared to new 5G offerings.
